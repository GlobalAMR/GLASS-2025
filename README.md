# GLASS-report
This repository provides Rcode for the figures featuring in the GLASS 2024 report

## 2024 GLASS report - Objectives 
1) Present progress in participation of countries in the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) and the progress in global AMR surveillance coverage at national, regional and global levels. This will help contextualize AMR findings and interpretation, to inform strategic and concrete actions for the next phase of GLASS. 

2) Summarize global AMR data from 2016 –to 2022, with emphasis on the latest calendar year of data (that is, 2022)1 


## 2024 GLASS report - Audience 
The 2024 GLASS Report is intended for a broad audience, including: 

1) National Ministries of Health: to inform and guide national health policies and strategies. 
2) Public health agencies and practitioners: to provide data and insights necessary for effective public health interventions. 
3) Policy makers: to support the development of informed policies and regulations. 
4) Academia: to offer data for research and education on antimicrobial resistance. 
5) General public: to raise awareness and understanding of AMR and its global implications

3.3	GLASS-AMR surveillance coverage\ 
Figure 3.6: Progress in reporting of BCIs and AST test results to GLASS-AMR for infectious syndromes under surveillance (2016-2020)\ 
Figure 3.7a-d: (Bubble) Map of BCIs with AST results reported to GLASS-AMR per one million population for selected infectious syndromes under surveillance (2016, 2018, 2020)\ 
Figure 3.8a-d: Progress in reporting AST results to GLASS-AMR for selected antimicrobial groups in Bloodstream BCIs by bacterial pathogens under surveillance (2016-2020)\ 
Figure 3.9a-c: (Bubble map of) Bloodstream infections with third-generation cephalosporins (E. coli) or methicillin resistance (S. aureus) susceptibility test results reported to GLASS-AMR, per one million population (2016, 2018, 2020) – Also for Salmonella spp gastrointestinal with fluoroquinolone sus. And Acinetobacter spp. And K. Pneumoniae BSI.\ 

4	Global and regional resistance to antibiotics\ 
4.1	Resistance to antibiotics under surveillance in 2022\ 
Table 4.1: Numbers of BCIs, BCIs with AST results for any antibacterial, and CTAs reporting BCIs in 2022\ 
Figure 4.1 (a-x): Resistance to antibiotics under surveillance in 2022 (title to be tailored to infectious syndrome and bacterial pathogen featured in the plot)\ 
Figure 4.2: Disaggregation by age and gender and potentially infection origin\ 
Figure 4.3 (a): Frequency of bloodstream BCIs due to bacterial pathogens under surveillance per 100 000 tested patients\ 
Figure 4.3 (b): Frequency of drug-resistant bloodstream BCIs due to bacterial 	pathogen under surveillance per 100 000 tested patients\ 

4.2	Time series of resistance to selected antibiotics, 2017-2022 ! (will be more challenging as not all countries have consequetive data) Could see if we can do something different than only use complete countries\ 
Figure 4.4a-e: Time series of resistance to selected antimicrobials in CTAs reporting ≥10 bloodstream BCIs with AST results annually (2017-2020) – by syndrome and certain bacteria.\
