This repository provides Rcode for the figures featuring in the GLASS 2024 report

## 2025 GLASS report - Objectives 
1) Present progress in participation of countries in the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) and the progress in global AMR surveillance coverage at national, regional and global levels. 

2) Summarize global AMR data from 2016 to 2023 


## 2025 GLASS report - Audience 
The 2025 GLASS Report is intended for a broad audience, including: 

1) National Ministries of Health: to inform and guide national health policies and strategies. 
2) Public health agencies and practitioners: to provide data and insights necessary for effective public health interventions. 
3) Policy makers: to support the development of informed policies and regulations. 
4) Academia: to offer data for research and education on antimicrobial resistance. 
5) General public: to raise awareness and understanding of AMR and its global implications
